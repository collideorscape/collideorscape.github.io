Collideorscape specializes in 'creative delegation' â€“ designing frameworks and workflows where human and other intelligences collide and escape traditional notions of creative production. They maintain that coding is best left to those who enjoy it, while they focus on the more rewarding task of discovering what creating something even means in this post-core landscape.

Which by the way is a pretty pretentious way to just say that we are interested in creative computation but not so much in code itself, but then transformers, llms, agent swarms, happened and, wow, we can do stuff!
